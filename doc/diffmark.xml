  <para><application>diffmark</application> is an XML diff and merge
  package. It consists of a shared C++ library,
  <filename>libdiffmark</filename>, plus two programs wrapping the
  library into a command-line interface: <command>dm</command> and
  <command>dm-merge</command>. <command>dm</command> takes 2 XML files
  and prints their diff (also an XML document) on its standard
  output. <command>dm-merge</command> takes the first document passed
  to dm and its output and produces the second document.</para>

  <para><application>diffmark</application> has a close (not to say
  convoluted) relationship
  with the Perl module <application>XML::DifferenceMarkup</application>
  (available on
  <ulink url="http://www.cpan.org">CPAN</ulink>). Current versions of
  <application>XML::DifferenceMarkup</application> are built on top of
  <filename>libdiffmark</filename>, making the packages compatible.
  Thanks to <ulink url="http://belski.net">Anatol Belski</ulink>, 
  <filename>libdiffmark</filename> now also has a 
  <ulink url="http://pecl.php.net/xmldiff">PHP frontend</ulink>.
  <filename>libdiffmark</filename> depends on
  <application>libxml2</application> (available from
  <ulink url="http://xmlsoft.org"/>).</para>

  <para>The diff format is meant to be human-readable
  (i.e. simple, as opposed to short) - basically the diff is a subset
  of the input trees, annotated with instruction element nodes
  specifying how to convert the source tree to the target by inserting
  and deleting nodes. To prevent name colisions with input trees, all
  added elements are in a namespace
  <systemitem>http://www.locus.cz/diffmark</systemitem>
  (the diff will fail on input trees which already use that
  namespace).</para>

  <para>The top-level node of the diff is always
  <markup>&lt;diff&gt;</markup> (or rather <markup>&lt;dm:diff
  xmlns:dm="http://www.locus.cz/diffmark"&gt;
  ... &lt;/dm:diff&gt;</markup> - this description omits the namespace
  specification from now on); under it are fragments of the input
  trees and instruction nodes: <markup>&lt;insert/&gt;</markup>,
  <markup>&lt;delete/&gt;</markup> and
  <markup>&lt;copy/&gt;</markup>. <markup>&lt;copy/&gt;</markup> is
  used in places where the input subtrees are the same - in the limit,
  the diff of 2 identical documents is

  <programlisting><![CDATA[<?xml version="1.0"?>
<dm:diff xmlns:dm="http://www.locus.cz/XML/diffmark">
  <dm:copy count="1"/>
</dm:diff>]]></programlisting>

  (<markup>&lt;copy/&gt;</markup> always has the count attribute and
  no other content).</para>

  <para><markup>&lt;insert/&gt;</markup> and
  <markup>&lt;delete/&gt;</markup> have the obvious meaning - in the
  limit a diff of 2 documents which have nothing in common is
  something like

  <programlisting><![CDATA[<?xml version="1.0"?>
<dm:diff xmlns:dm="http://www.locus.cz/XML/diffmark">
  <dm:delete>
    <old/>
  </dm:delete>
  <dm:insert>
    <new>
      <tree>with the whole subtree, of course</tree>
    </new>
  </dm:insert>
</dm:diff>]]></programlisting>
  </para>

  <para>A combination of <markup>&lt;insert/&gt;</markup>,
  <markup>&lt;delete/&gt;</markup> and <markup>&lt;copy/&gt;</markup>
  can capture any difference, but it's sub-optimal for the case where
  (for example) the top-level elements in the two input documents
  differ while their subtrees are exactly the same. dm handles this
  case by putting the element from the second document into the diff,
  adding to it a special attribute <markup>dm:update</markup> (whose
  value is the element name from the first document) marking the
  element change:

  <programlisting><![CDATA[<?xml version="1.0"?>
<dm:diff xmlns:dm="http://www.locus.cz/XML/diffmark">
  <top-of-second dm:update="top-of-first">
    <dm:copy count="42"/>
  </top-of-second>
</dm:diff>]]></programlisting>  
  </para>

  <para><markup>&lt;delete/&gt;</markup> contains just one level of
  nested nodes - their subtrees are not included in the diff (but the
  element nodes which are included always come with all their
  attributes). <markup>&lt;insert/&gt;</markup> and
  <markup>&lt;delete/&gt;</markup> don't have any attributes and
  always contain some subtree.</para>

  <para>Instruction nodes are never nested; all nodes above an
  instruction node (except the top-level
  <markup>&lt;diff/&gt;</markup>) come from the input trees. A node
  from the second input tree might be included in the output diff to
  provide context for instruction nodes when it's an element node
  whose subtree is not the same in the two input documents. When such
  an element has the same name, attributes (names and values) and
  namespace declarations in both input documents, it's always included
  in the diff (its different output trees guarantee that it will have
  some chindren there). If the corresponding elements are different,
  the one from the second document might still be included, with an
  added <markup>dm:update</markup> attribute, provided that both
  corresponding elements have non-empty subtrees, and these subtrees
  are so similar that deleting the first corresponding element and
  inserting the second would lead to a larger diff. And if this
  paragraph seems too complicated, don't despair - just ignore it and
  look at some examples.</para>
